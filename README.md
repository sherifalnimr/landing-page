# Landing Page Project

landing page project

in this projet, i had used the guideline of the project as well as W3c school editor.
the aim is :
build a Navigation bar dynmically by reading the count of number of sections , [ nodelist ]
then use the loop to create an un ordlered list and turn it to navbar using CSS and Javascript as shown in the code.
the help of the last webinar was very much appreciated
